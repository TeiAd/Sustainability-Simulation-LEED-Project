# Sustainability-Simulation-LEED-Project
A simulation project focused on preparing for LEED certification and sustainability benchmarks

# Objective
This project simulates the preparation process for certifying a sustainable facility under the LEED framework. It explores key project deliverables, including stakeholder engagement, implementation timelines, benchmarks, and compliance with Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs) and prerequisites.

# Key Deliverables
Stakeholder Register: Identified stakeholders crucial for LEED certification and their roles/responsibilities.

Timeline (Gantt Chart): A detailed implementation schedule for achieving project milestones.

Benchmarks: Critical success metrics for energy efficiency, water management, and sustainable materials.

Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs): Guidelines for LEED project eligibility.

Prerequisites: Baseline requirements for LEED certification compliance.

# Workbook
This Excel workbook contains:

Stakeholder Register with roles and responsibilities.

Timeline: Gantt chart of implementation phases.

Benchmarks: Sustainability performance metrics.

MPRs and Prerequisites: Detailed checklists.

# Python code for Ganttchart
This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/TeiAd/Sustainability-Simulation-LEED-Project/blob/main/LEED%20Gantt.ipynb)  contains the python code for the Ganttchart 

# Why This Project Matters
This project showcases my ability to:

Apply sustainability principles to real-world scenarios.
Work with frameworks like LEED, WELL, and Fitwel.
Manage projects effectively using tools such as Gantt charts and stakeholder analysis.
