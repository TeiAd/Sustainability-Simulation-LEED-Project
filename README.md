# Sustainability-Simulation-LEED-Project
A simulation project focused on preparing for LEED certification and sustainability benchmarks

# Objective
This project simulates the preparation process for certifying a sustainable facility under the LEED framework. It explores key project deliverables, including stakeholder engagement, implementation timelines, benchmarks, and compliance with Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs) and prerequisites.

# Key Deliverables
Stakeholder Register: Identified stakeholders crucial for LEED certification and their roles/responsibilities.
Timeline (Gantt Chart): A detailed implementation schedule for achieving project milestones.
Benchmarks: Critical success metrics for energy efficiency, water management, and sustainable materials.
Minimum Program Requirements (MPRs): Guidelines for LEED project eligibility.
Prerequisites: Baseline requirements for LEED certification compliance.

# Workbook
The Excel workbook contains:
Stakeholders: Register with roles and responsibilities.
Timeline: Gantt chart of implementation phases.
Benchmarks: Sustainability performance metrics.
MPRs and Prerequisites: Detailed checklists.
